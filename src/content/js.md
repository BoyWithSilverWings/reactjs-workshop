## How to learn JavaScript

I think it's best that you figure this out yourself.

But here are a few guidelines to get you started:

- Make sure you know your way around the documentation (If all you have is a hammer everything will look like nail)
- Know what JS can do and cannot do.
- Make something, publish it to [Github](https://github.com), add it to [Codepen](https://codepen.io) - Don't make it huge, make it yours.
- Don't be afraid to tweet your journey, write a blog post, create a status and more - Learn in Public.
  Practice.
